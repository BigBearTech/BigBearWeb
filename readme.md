# Big Bear Web

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BigBearTech/BigBearWeb.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/BigBearTech/BigBearWeb)

Is a full featured Content Management System. We are in the early stages of development. It's built on the awesome Laravel Framework.

# Why Another CMS

I think everything can be improved upon! I've tried allot of CMS's and they don't have all the things you need in a great website. Yes you can go to Plugins for those certain things but then you have to rely on the 3rd party developer to keep maintenance up.

# Goals
 - Setup guide when the user firsts installs it!
 - Blog System
 - Pages
 - Testimonials
 - FAQ's
 - Media System
 - Photo Galleries
 - Comment System - Self Hosted - disqus
 - User System
 - Full Featured API - For external apps
 - Theme System
 - Mod/Plugin System
 - Best Practices for SEO
